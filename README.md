# OpenGL Assignment: Cyan Obtuse Triangles

## Project Description

This project demonstrates a simple **OpenGL (C++)** program that draws **two cyan-colored obtuse triangles** positioned at **two distant corners of the screen** on an **orange background** using **GLFW** and **GLAD**.

The program also shows basic window handling and keyboard input processing in OpenGL.

## Requirements Implemented

✔ Orange background using `glClearColor`
✔ Two **cyan-colored obtuse triangles**
✔ Triangles placed at **two distant corners of the window**
✔ Window title set to **full name**
✔ Window closes when the **initial letter of the name** is pressed

---

## Window Information

* **Window Title:** Fayruz Humayra
* **Window Size:** 800 × 600
* **Graphics API:** OpenGL 3.3 Core Profile

---

## Controls

* Press **F** (initial letter of the name) to close the window.

---

## Technologies Used

* **C++**
* **OpenGL**
* **GLFW** – for window creation and input handling
* **GLAD** – for loading OpenGL functions
* **VS Code** – development environment

---

## How It Works

* Vertex and Fragment shaders are used to render shapes.
* Vertex Buffer Object (VBO) and Vertex Array Object (VAO) store triangle data.
* Two obtuse triangles are defined using vertex coordinates.
* The fragment shader assigns a cyan color to the triangles.
* The background is cleared with an orange color each frame.

---

## How to Run

1. Open the project in **VS Code**
2. Make sure **GLFW** and **GLAD** are properly configured
3. Compile and run the C++ file
4. Press **F** to close the window

---

## Output Description

When the program runs:

* An orange background appears
* Two cyan-colored obtuse triangles are visible at opposite corners of the screen
* Pressing **F** closes the window

---

## Conclusion

This project successfully fulfills all the given requirements by rendering two cyan obtuse triangles at distant corners on an orange background while demonstrating basic OpenGL rendering and input handling in C++.
